## Project Description
This repository implements a multi-signature wallet contract that:
- Requires M-of-N owner approvals to execute transactions
- Supports configurable approval thresholds and multiple owners
- Queues transactions until required confirmations are reached
- Allows owners to revoke confirmations before execution
- Records all operations on-chain with event logging for full transparency

Use cases: DAO treasuries, enterprise crypto custody, shared wallets for teams or families.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- 🔐 Multi-Signature Security: M-of-N signatures required to execute
- 👥 Multiple Owners: Any number of owners supported
- 📝 Transaction Queue: Submit, review, and approve transactions before execution
- ✅ Flexible Approval Threshold: Customize number of required confirmations
- 🔄 Revocable Confirmations: Owners can revoke approvals prior to execution

### Security Features
- 🛡️ Access Control: Only designated owners can submit/confirm transactions
- 🔒 Prevention of Double Execution: Transactions execute only once
- 📊 Full Transparency: All transactions and confirmations recorded on-chain
- ⚡ Event Logging: Events emitted for monitoring and off-chain tracking
- 💰 Direct ETH Deposits: Receive ETH securely via contract receive/fallback

### Management Features
- 📋 Transaction History: Inspect submitted and executed transactions
- 👀 Real-time Status: Check confirmation counts for pending transactions
- 💼 Balance Tracking: View contract balance on-chain
- 🎯 Data Payload Support: Execute complex contract interactions (calls with data)

---

## How it Works (Overview)
1. An owner submits a transaction (to, value, data).
2. Owners confirm the transaction. Each owner can confirm once.
3. When confirmations >= required threshold, any owner can execute the transaction.
4. Confirmations can be revoked by owners before execution.
5. Execution emits events; the wallet prevents re-execution of the same transaction.

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Enhanced Security
- 🔑 Owner Management: Add/remove owners via multi-sig approval
- ⏰ Timelock Mechanism: Optional waiting period before execution
- 🚨 Emergency Pause: Freeze wallet in case of compromise
- 📱 2FA Integration: Additional authentication layer (off-chain)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- 💎 ERC-20 Token Support: Manage tokens in addition to ETH
- 🎨 NFT Management: Multi-sig control for NFT transfers
- 📊 Spending Limits: Configurable daily/weekly caps
- 🔄 Batch Transactions: Execute multiple transactions atomically

### Phase 3: User Experience
- 🖥️ Web Interface: React-based dashboard for management
- 📱 Mobile App: iOS/Android apps for approvals on the go
- 🔔 Notification System: Email/SMS/push alerts for pending transactions
- 📈 Analytics Dashboard: Visualize transaction history and spending

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features
- 🏢 Role-Based Permissions: Different approval weights/levels
- 📝 Transaction Templates: Reusable pre-approved transaction patterns
- 🔐 Hardware Wallet Integration: Ledger/Trezor support
- 🌐 Multi-Chain Support: Deploy across multiple blockchains

### Phase 5: DeFi Integration
- 💱 DEX Integration: Swap tokens with multi-sig approval
- 🏦 Yield Farming: Stake/unstake assets with multi-sig control
- 📊 Portfolio Management: Track DeFi positions under multi-sig custody
- 🤝 Protocol Integration: Interact with lending/borrowing protocols securely
